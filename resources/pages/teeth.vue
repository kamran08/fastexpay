                    In order to maintain the whitest teeth possible, it is important to be aware of how teeth discolor. Many things 
                    can cause staining or discoloration.  It is normal for teeth to dull with age, but there are also avoidable risk 
                    factors such as consuming foods and drinks that can stain.  The main culprits of a lackluster or yellowed smile are tea, 
                    coffee, red wine, and tobacco.  Fortunately, teeth whitening is one of the most cost-effective and quickest ways
                    to take your smile from blah to beaming.
